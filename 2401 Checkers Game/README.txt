CS 2401 Spring 2015 Final Project: Checkers Game

This project was to make a Checkers game where the user plays against the computer. 
The game is built from several classes, one that creates the game spaces, another
that creates the Checkers part of the game, and at the highest level, a class that 
controls the workings of the game.

The assignment was to implement this game in three stages: first, simply designing 
the game board and playing the first move, second, making a two-player game, and
finally, making a user vs. computer game. 

The game needs to be compiled with "g++ *.cc" and will prompt the user for moves 
and input.
